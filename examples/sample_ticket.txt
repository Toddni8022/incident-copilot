prod db slow, users reporting 500 errors on checkout page starting around 2:45pm
checked logs - connection pool maxed out
dave restarted db instance at 3:10
errors stopped at 3:15 
looks like the marketing batch job ran during business hours instead of overnight
need to fix cron schedule and add connection pool monitoring
also maybe increase pool size from 50 to 100
